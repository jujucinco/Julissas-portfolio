                <p>As high speed wifi, video conferencing, synchronous and asynchronous communication has advanced in the last 10 years, remote work has grown exponentially. It’s common to see fully remote workforces, digital nomads who work from their laptops in an exotic location, and coworking spaces on every corner. Along with all the perks, however, comes a major downside. <span class="boldchallenge">Isolation is a prominent complaint among many location independent employees,</span> which is directly responsible for the rise in coworking spaces. Although lacking a traditional workplace watercooler, the desire to connect for professional networking or just friends remains.  In the case of digital nomads, these connections are sometimes even more important, as they are not as easily able to build relationships on the go. As someone who has personally seen coworkers struggle with this, and noticing current apps for this demographic fall short, I set out to bridge this gap myself. </p>

It was just about blending everything together in a unique way that addresses the core problem of isolation when not working in an office environment.

                <br>
                <li>Many remote workers try to connect with others through meetups or Facebook groups, but none of my respondents use an app specifically for this demographic. </li>
                <br>
                <li>A common frustration (24% of respondents) was being easily distracted in a public space or at home while working remotely. I noted user’s desires to know how quiet a location was as an amenity.  </li>
                <br>
                <li>The longer someone was remote, the less isolated they reported feeling. This may coincide with just getting used to the isolation, or, with a growing family and therefore support system as they grew older. </li>

            <h2>Drawings and Frames</h2>
            <p>As always, getting ideas down on paper makes the creative juices flow, which I then turned into wireframes. When sketching and wireframing, I like to use real content that I’ve already written up to get more of a real feel for the layout and number of screens.

            <p>User testing the wireframes are the first real glimpse into which of my ideas are working or not. Because the low fidelity of the screens required a quick and dirty method, I went with Maze. Having users test some of the core functions and seeing if they recognized iconography led to some important improvements. </p>

            <p>There is a gaping whitespace available to fill for this rapidly growing demographic of remote workers and digital nomads. Many would say distributed teams will be the new normal for businesses, and as Slack becomes the new office , so will concerns of isolation and loneliness. Open Space solves this problem by enabling an easy, fun way to connect with likeminded people who are already in the same place you are. It also solves some secondary problems discovered through my research, such as the frustration of working in a loud space or one with poor wifi.   <br>
            <br>
            Something I had to think about throughout the project was the massive amount of user submitted data an app like this requires. It would take time to garner enough data to be able to compete in a space with Workfrom or Workhardanywhere. To overcome this, good UX and offering highly coveted features is essential. A possible opportunity to expand in the future and a feature my survey respondents expressed some interest in, would be the addition of connecting with others for dating, instead of just for professional purposes or friends. <br>
