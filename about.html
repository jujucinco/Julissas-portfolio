                 <h2>Hola!</h2><br>
                 
                 <p> Iâ€™m Julissa (like Julie, but with â€˜ssaâ€™ at the end), and Iâ€™m a UX designer who loves pixels and people.<br>
                    <br>
                Iâ€™m originally from the Dominican Republic, but grew up between Florida and Boston. Just a few key points about this:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I do speak native Spanish, but am not any good at baseball.</li>
                    <li>No, the Florida crazy did not rub off on me.</li>
                    <li>Yes, I am a Patriots fan, but one of the few humble ones ðŸ™‚ .</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Now that that's out of the way...</p>
                <h2>Taking the Scenic Route</h2><br>
                <p>Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the human mind, behaviors and motivations. Growing up in a tight knit family with four brothers, 3 out of 4 a software developer, I also grew up around quite a bit of tech talk. This was also equally fascinating to me, but upon getting to college and looking around, I didnâ€™t see anyone who looked like me in the CS programs. I was convinced this field â€˜wasnâ€™t for a girl like meâ€™.  So I pursued my interest in the human mind, completed a degree in psychology, and started a career in research. <br>
                <br>
                I couldnâ€™t shake my curiosity for tech, and this eventually landed me with a role at TripAdvisor. Here I got the opportunity to wear many different hats, including regular collaboration with the product team. I provided user feedback to our product designers that would lead to feature fixes and enhancements. This was my first introduction to UX, and I was positively hooked. A marriage between psychology and tech that results in beautiful UI babies, what could be better? My psychology background gave me an innate sense of empathy for our users, and I often found myself redesigning the site and my teamâ€™s tools in my head. I started learning anything and everything I could on my own, and started jumping in more in the UX conversations. From the reactions I got, I realized I had good instinct for this field, and set out to fill in any knowledge gaps with more formal education. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive mentorship from Mike Dekker under Thinkful, who instilled in me a sense of pixel perfectionism and thoughtful designs. This program was fully remote, and my previous role was partially remote, so Iâ€™m well versed in the pros and cons of remote culture and how to navigate it. I'm currently based in FL and open to another remote opportunity. For more about my recent work, check out my case studies <a href="index.html#classkarmaprojectid">here</a>.

                <p>When Iâ€™m not creating on my MacBook, I like to read, write (currently working on a short story), like most people; travel, and host extremely competitive game nights. Iâ€™m also the dog mom of an adorable Schnoodle named Melo who is very mellow.
