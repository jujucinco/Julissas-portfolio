                 <h2>Hola!</h2><br>
                 
                 <p> Iâ€™m Julissa (like Julie, but with â€˜ssaâ€™ at the end), and Iâ€™m a UX designer who loves pixels and people.<br>
                    <br>
                Iâ€™m originally from the Dominican Republic, but grew up between Florida and Boston. Just a few key points about this:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I do speak native Spanish, but am not any good at baseball.</li>
                    <li>No, the Florida crazy did not rub off on me.</li>
                    <li>Yes, I am a Patriots fan, but one of the few humble ones ðŸ™‚ .</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Now that that's out of the way...</p>
                <h2>Taking the Scenic Route</h2><br>
                <p>Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the human mind, behaviors and motivations. Growing up in a tight knit family with four brothers, 3 out of 4 a software developer, I also grew up around quite a bit of tech talk. This was also equally fascinating to me, but upon getting to college and looking around, I didnâ€™t see anyone who looked like me in the CS programs. I was convinced this field â€˜wasnâ€™t for a girl like meâ€™.  So I pursued my interest in the human mind, completed a degree in psychology, and started a career in research. <br>
                <br>
                I couldnâ€™t shake my curiosity for tech, and this eventually landed me with a role at TripAdvisor. Here I got the opportunity to wear many different hats, including regular collaboration with the product team. I provided user feedback to our product designers that would lead to feature fixes and enhancements. This was my first introduction to UX, and I was positively hooked. A marriage between psychology and tech that results in beautiful UI babies, what could be better? My psychology background gave me an innate sense of empathy for our users, and I often found myself redesigning the site and my teamâ€™s tools in my head. I started learning anything and everything I could on my own, and started jumping in more in the UX conversations. From the reactions I got, I realized I had good instinct for this field, and set out to fill in any knowledge gaps with more formal education. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive mentorship from Mike Dekker under Thinkful, who instilled in me a sense of pixel perfectionism and thoughtful designs. This program was fully remote, and my previous role was partially remote, so Iâ€™m well versed in the pros and cons of remote culture and how to navigate it.

                <p>When iâ€™m not creating on my MacBook, I like to read, write (currently working on a short story), like most people; travel, and host extremely competitive game nights. Iâ€™m also the dog mom of an adorable Schnoodle named Melo who is very mellow.
                Behold, he let me put him in here and enjoyed it:</p>
