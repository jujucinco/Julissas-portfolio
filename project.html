                <p>Cloud storage apps have become a necessity for many, whether it be for work, school, or to store our massive photo libraries. There are several big names already in this game, most notably, Google, iCloud and Dropbox.<br>
                <br>
                When I was asked to create a cloud storage app concept, I saw an opportunity to stand out in a crowded field by catering to a niche market: college students. <span class="boldchallenge">I set out to create the kind of collaborative app many of us wish we had in our schooling years, while prioritizing my client needs.</span> </p>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                     My client wanted a cloud storage solution that met a few basic requirements, such as the ability to save content from the web and collaborate in real time. Those were my only constraints, otherwise I had free rein to create any concept and brand I could imagine and choose the audience I wanted to appeal to.<br>
                     <br>
                     Several months ago, in a conversation with my younger brother, he told me about his frustration with no-show classmates who just copied his notes and got the same A he did. This got me thinking, <span class="boldchallenge">what if there was a solution that allowed classmates to share and collaborate with each other fairly and efficiently? </span>

                <p class="centered surveyp">I conducted a survey to gauge the current use of cloud storage solutions and pain points. It was important to gather responses from students and non-students alike to assess general cloud storage app issues, and student-specific ones.</p>
                <div class="surveyflextext">
                <h3>Pain Point #1: Organization is difficult</h3>
                <p>Users lamented the lack of easy organization options available in their current cloud storage solution. My research into this found the most popular apps among survey participants only provide the option to move a file to a folder and color code it, but no tagging abilities. </p>
                <h3>Pain Point #2: Lack of storage space</h3>
                <p>Google Drive’s 15GB is one of the most generous free storage options available, but it still proved to be insufficient. This is because the storage is shared with the user's gmail. My research found that without this factor, this amount of storage would be sufficient for our app concept.</p>
                <h3>Pain Point #3: Not easy to use</h3>
                <p>Some users felt that their current solution had several steps in order to complete a simple action, such as editing a document. </p>

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>Although most were direct successes, usability testing was eye opening for me, as it revealed usability issues with components commonly used across apps. For example the “more” icon, used in order to locate additional actions for a given element, was not immediately noticed by all four of my participants, with one noting that they never really knew what that was used for. </p>

            <p>I addressed the client needs, our target users main pain points, and a new feature that will set the app apart from competitors. Shown above from left to right:</p>
            <p>• Ability to scan. This is a feature not widely offered by competitors, and something 94% of my survey respondents said may be useful to them for scanning hard copy notes.</p>
            <p>• The tagging feature addresses user's organizational pain point and gives them another option other than organizing by folder or color.</p>
            <p>• ClassKarma offers ample storage to encourage collaboration. Karma points helps address our initial problem of unfair sharing of class notes. Students have to contribute to get karma points and get more access to other student’s notes. </p>
            <p>• Ability to easily share single files or entire folders, as requested by the client.</p>

                Although a statistically insignificant margin, The only test with a slight preference with 42 users was the hero section logo. Users did not seem to have a preference for either of the variations for the cancel text placement or log in screen. This was at least reassurance that either of my designs would have been successful. I did a bit more research and went with the design that most closely matched current app design patterns.

            <p>Testing the high fidelity version brings a lot more fidelity to the test and gives the user a much better sense of what the app could actually do. It’s also reassuring to know your research, testing and iterating process is working because users breeze through the tasks in this stage. This was the case here, with users completing all tasks easily and efficiently and with minimal feedback. </p>

            <p>Cloud storage apps are a great solution for collaborating and sharing with more ease and efficiency. There was a need within a specific market of cloud storage app users that were not having all of their needs met with the current apps available to them. With this solution, I addressed my client's requirements, general cloud storage app pain points, and tailored the app for our college student demographic. With the gamification feature included, our primary problem of unfair student collaboration is addressed. <br>
            <br>
            An important reminder from this project is that the process is essential. Particularly when working with a client who is not sure what direction they want to take the project, making sure each step is done thoughtfully and intentionally is key. This ensures our decisions can be backed up with and that the end result makes sense. And of course, the importance of user testing (and more user testing) can never be emphasized enough. When certain things just don’t work like you think they will, like common icons and language, users are there to ground you and make you take a step back.<br>
            <br>
            There are plenty of opportunities to expand features for ClassKarma in future updates (social, chat, classmate invites…) which will make this app even more competitive in this space.</p>
