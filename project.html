            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud storage apps have become a necessity for many, whether it be for work, school, or to store our massive photo libraries. There are several big names already in this game, most notably, Google, iCloud and Dropbox. 

                When I was asked to create a cloud storage app concept, I saw an opportunity to stand out in a crowded field by catering to a niche market: College Students. I set out to create the kind of collaborative app many of us wish we had in our schooling years, while prioritizing my client needs.

            <p>A cloud storage app that marries our client wants with a bridge for the gap in the market. This made our solution a viable competitor among a sea of Dropbox’s, Google Drives and Evernotes:

            <h2>Survey Results</h2>
            <p>I conducted a survey to gauge the current use of cloud storage solutions and pain points:</p>
            <h3>Pain Point #1: Organization is difficult</h3>
            <p>Users lamented the lack of easy organization options available in their current cloud storage solution. My research into this found the most popular apps among survey participants only provide the option to move a file to a folder and color code it, but no tagging abilities. </p>
            <h3>Pain Point #2: Lack of storage space</h3>
            <p>Even Google Drive’s 15GB is not sufficient for an app that encourages sharing and collaboration. With the ability to save all of our phone’s photos to these cloud storage solutions, users expect to not have to constantly remove content in order to upload more.</p>
            <h3>Pain Point #3: Not easy to use</h3>
            <p>Some users felt that their current solution had several steps in order to complete a simple action, such as editing a document. </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projectimages/donutchartlegend.png" alt="donut chart">
            </div>

            <p>Through this survey, I also found 100% of participants who said they used a cloud storage solution for school said they shared notes with classmates and/or asked classmates to share notes with them. Users are using cloud storage solutions for this purpose, but they are doing so with the popular cloud storage solutions that do not target this specific use case. </p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>In order to understand the market we would be entering into, I conducted a SWOT analysis on the top 3 apps used by my survey participants.Through this analysis, I found weaknesses in the market I could leverage while building this solution. </p>

            <p>Through some mind mapping, I arrived at the name ClassKarma. I used the word “Class”, due to being a cloud storage solution for class collaboration, and “Karma” which was a play on the gamification feature I planned to implement to ensure the collaboration and sharing was fair.</p>

            <p> Karma means, what goes around comes around, or effect from cause. I wanted my logo to include some reference to this, while identifying it as a cloud storage solution. I iterated on a series of sketches and arrived at the final logo.</p>

            <p>I wanted the color palette to feel youthful and interesting, without being overwhelming. I went with accent colors bright sky blue and burnt orange, and a tint of the burnt orange that was used exclusively for the mobile app. The darker grey hue was primarily used for text, while the lighter grey was used more seldom, such as in the desktop footer. I used a significant amount of white space to ensure my design had room to breath. </p>

                Although a statistically insignificant margin, The only test with a slight preference with 42 users was the hero section logo. Users did not seem to have a preference for either of the variations for the cancel text placement or log in screen. This was at least reassurance that either of my designs would have been successful. I did a bit more research and went with the design that most closely matched current app design patterns.

            <h2>More Testing</h2>
            <p>Testing the high fidelity version brings a lot more fidelity to the test and gives the user a much better sense of what the app could actually do. It’s also reassuring to know your research, testing and iterating process is working because users breeze through the tasks in your high fidelity test. This was also the case in this project, with users completing all tasks easily and efficiently and with minimal feedback. </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Cloud storage apps are a great solution to get people to collaborate and share with more ease and efficiency. There was a need for a specific market of cloud storage app users that were not having all of their needs met with the current solutions available to them. 

            An important reminder from this project is that the process is essential. Particularly when working with a client who is not sure what direction they want to take the project, making sure each step is done thoughtfully makes everyone’s job easier in the end. And of course, the importance of user testing (and more user testing) can never be emphasized enough. When certain things just don’t work like you think they will, like common icons and language, users are there to ground you and make you take a step back. 
                    
            There are plenty of opportunities to expand features for ClassKarma in future updates (social, chat, classmate invites…) which will make this app even more competitive in this space.</p>
