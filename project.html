                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Cloud storage apps have become a necessity for many, whether it be for work, school, or to store our massive photo libraries. There are several big names already in this game, most notably, Google, iCloud and Dropbox.<br>
                    <br>
                    When I was asked to create a cloud storage app concept, I saw an opportunity to stand out in a crowded field by catering to a niche market: College Students. <span class="boldchallenge">I set out to create the kind of collaborative app many of us wish we had in our schooling years, while prioritizing my client needs.</span>

                <h3>Pain Point #1: Organization is difficult</h3>
                <p>Users lamented the lack of easy organization options available in their current cloud storage solution. My research into this found the most popular apps among survey participants only provide the option to move a file to a folder and color code it, but no tagging abilities. </p>
                <h3>Pain Point #2: Lack of storage space</h3>
                <p>Even Google Drive’s 15GB is not sufficient for an app that encourages sharing and collaboration. With the ability to save all of our phone’s photos to these cloud storage solutions, users expect to not have to constantly remove content in order to upload more.</p>
                <h3>Pain Point #3: Not easy to use</h3>
                <p>Some users felt that their current solution had several steps in order to complete a simple action, such as editing a document. </p>

            <h2>Name</h2>
            <p>Through some mind mapping, I arrived at the name ClassKarma. I used the word “Class”, due to being a cloud storage solution for class collaboration, and “Karma” which was a play on the gamification feature I planned to implement to ensure the collaboration and sharing was fair.</p>

        </div>

            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p> Karma means, what goes around comes around, or effect from cause. I wanted my logo to include some reference to this, while identifying it as a cloud storage solution. I iterated on a series of sketches and arrived at the final logo.</p>

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p> I chose Fredoka One and Quicksand for their complementary styles, ease of legibility and the emotion they evoked. I was going for a light, fun feel that appealed to my young demographic, and I feel these two typefaces did that beautifully.</p>

            <h2>Color Palette</h2>
            <p>I wanted the color palette to feel youthful and interesting, without being overwhelming. I went with accent colors bright sky blue and burnt orange, and a tint of the burnt orange that was used exclusively for the mobile app. The darker grey hue was primarily used for text, while the lighter grey was used more seldom, such as in the desktop footer. I used a significant amount of white space to ensure my design had room to breath. </p>

            <h2>Buttons</h2>
            <p>For desktop and mobile buttons, I followed iOS interface guidelines best practices for sizing (minimum of 40px)</p>

            <p>I addressed the client needs, our target users main pain points, and a new feature that will set the app apart from competitors. Shown above from left to right:</p>
            <p>• Ability to scan. This is a feature not widely offered by competitors, and something 94% of my survey respondents said may be useful to them for scanning hard copy notes.</p>
            <p>• Tagging addresses organizational pain point, gives user another option other than organizing by folder or color.</p>
            <p>• Offering ample storage to encourage collaboration. Karma points helps address our initial problem of unfair sharing of class notes. Students have to contribute to get karma points and get more access to other student’s notes. </p>
            <p>• Ability to easily share single files or entire folders, as requested by the client.</p>
            <p>• An easy way to create content right in the app, easy to see who is currently working in a document.</p>

            <p>I did some A/B testing on some final design variations I couldn’t quite decide on, when this happens, I feel confident falling back on the user to decide for me. These tests asked 42 participants to decide between two hero section logos, a mobile log in screen layout, and the placement of “cancel” text. </p>

                Although a statistically insignificant margin, The only test with a slight preference with 42 users was the hero section logo. Users did not seem to have a preference for either of the variations for the cancel text placement or log in screen. This was at least reassurance that either of my designs would have been successful. I did a bit more research and went with the design that most closely matched current app design patterns.

            <p>Testing the high fidelity version brings a lot more fidelity to the test and gives the user a much better sense of what the app could actually do. It’s also reassuring to know your research, testing and iterating process is working because users breeze through the tasks in your high fidelity test. This was also the case in this project, with users completing all tasks easily and efficiently and with minimal feedback. </p>

            <p>Cloud storage apps are a great solution to get people to collaborate and share with more ease and efficiency. There was a need for a specific market of cloud storage app users that were not having all of their needs met with the current solutions available to them.<br>
            <br>
            An important reminder from this project is that the process is essential. Particularly when working with a client who is not sure what direction they want to take the project, making sure each step is done thoughtfully makes everyone’s job easier in the end. And of course, the importance of user testing (and more user testing) can never be emphasized enough. When certain things just don’t work like you think they will, like common icons and language, users are there to ground you and make you take a step back.<br>
            <br>
            There are plenty of opportunities to expand features for ClassKarma in future updates (social, chat, classmate invites…) which will make this app even more competitive in this space.</p>
